Writeup for Lab 10:

Task 2--
The domain of function 3 does not include any negative values 
because this makes the sqrt() function undefined. It does not 
include the value at approximately x = 0.4834139 because this 
is where the graph of f3 goes to negative infinity when 
approaching from the left and positive infinity when approaching 
from the right. I couldn't approximate this any closer than 
"between 0 and 1" using the GUI, so I used the TI-84.

Task 3--
This function oscillates with increasing intensity as it approaches
0, therefore the limit does not exist at x = 0.
